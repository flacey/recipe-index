## Servings
- 4 servings

## Serving Size
- 1-1/4 cups

## Ingredients
- 2 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes
- 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper, divided
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoons canola oil, divided
- 8 cups broccoli florets
- 1/4 cup water plus 1 tablespoon, divided
- 3/4 cup unsalted chicken broth
- 2-1/2 tablespoons hoisin sauce
- 1-1/2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
- 1-1/2 teaspoons fresh grated ginger
- 1-1/2 teaspoons grated garlic
- 1-1/2 teaspoons seasoned rice vinegar
- 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper
- 1 tablespoon cornstarch
- 1/4 cup sliced scallions
- 1 teaspoon white sesame seeds

## Instructions
1. Evenly season chicken with black pepper and salt. Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium heat. Add the chicken; cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and a thermometer inserted in the thickest parts 165Â°F, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate. Do not wipe the pan clean.
2. Return the pan to medium heat. Add broccoli and the remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil; stir until the florets are fully coated. Add 1/4 cup water; cover, and cook, undisturbed, until the broccoli is bright green and tender-crisp, about 2 minutes.
3. Whisk broth, hoisin, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, vinegar and white pepper together in a small bowl until fully combined. Pour the mixture over the broccoli; continue cooking over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reduces by one-quarter, about 3 minutes.
4. Whisk cornstarch and the remaining 1 tablespoon water together in a small bowl. Add to the pan; cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce has slightly thickened and coats the back of a spoon, about 1 minute.
5. Reduce heat to low. Add the chicken; cook, stirring, until evenly coated and heated through, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle with scallions and sesame seeds.

## Notes
- If you are pressed for time, you can use ground ginger (1/4 teaspoon ground equals 1 teaspoon fresh ginger).
